# Google Kick Start

These are my solutions to some Google Kick Start problems.

Some of them were made during the **contest** and some were made as **practice** for the contests of the following years.

Some of them are **full** solutions (they pass all the test sets) and some are **partial** solutions (they pass some test sets but not all of them).

## Solutions:

### 2019

- Problem A - [Number Guessing]: [A-NumberGuessing] (practice / full)
